### University Project on Breast Cancer
The title of this project is A Non-Invasive Method of Detecting Breast Cancer: Determining its Effectiveness. This was a project done during my final year at the University of Southampton part of the Mathematics Project module. 

**Description**: This project was to determine whether Fine Needle Aspiration is a good method of biopsy in the process of identifying breast cancer cells. The dataset includes abnormality scores of cell features extracted using fine needle aspiration and the patient's actual cancer diagnosis. We use the scores to build a model using logistic regression and see whether model is accurate in diagnosing cancer cells.
